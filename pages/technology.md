## Blockchain
Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are currently some of the most hyped technologies in the marketplace.  Most people recognise that blockchain is an important technology but very few organisations know how and when to use blockchain technologies.  

Capability Wise has the experience and expertise to determine if blockchain is the right solution to your business problem.  We have developed a substantial amount of novel intellectual property, including the specific application of blockchain to some critical business problems.  Our patented systems, processes and techniques allow us to rapidly deploy blockchain solutions for most Asset, Supply Chain and Regulatory use cases.

## APIs and Microservices
The API Economy and Microservices are hot topics at the moment.  Organisations can get it so right... or so wrong!  Good API design isn't as simple as throwing together a quick ReST/JSON API and spinning it up inside a container.

Organisations need to think about quality of service characteristics including fault tolerance, security and performance.  We can help you get your API Gateway design right the first time.  

What happens behind the gateway is a whole other story.  Determining the context and the right granularity of APIs and Microservices is tough.  We can help lead your team through this process, building the capability to allow your organisation to quickly stand on its own two feet.
