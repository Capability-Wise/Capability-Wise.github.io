I"ú<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office is the leading global tax administration for the provision of
API data services. Over the past 5 years it has progressively provision secure, very
high-volume data collection and dissemination services to the public, third-party
software providers and to government agencies.</p>

<p>The ATOâ€™s primary platform to deliver these data services is its eCommerce Platform. The
usage of these data services has increase dramatically over the last two years, with the
platform expect to process on average more that 1.4 million transactions per day by
October this year across a range of taxation, superannuation, and relationship management
services. This equates to over 1 billion transactions per annum.</p>

<p>Capability Wise in collaboration with our partner eBlueprint assisted the ATO to successfully plan, design, develop and transition-in this strategic capability across a multi-year period.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenges">The Challenges</h3>
<p>The ATO has been progressively increasing the volume of data it collects over the past 30
years to improve its understanding of each Businessâ€™ and Citizenâ€™s taxation circumstances.
As a result of this increased data collection the ATO progressively built more systems
and bespoke connections to support its users, until 2010 with the introduction of the
Standard Business Reporting (SBR 1) Version 1 platform.</p>

<p>SBR1 was hampered by low Software Developer adoption due to its use of complex and
proprietary standards. The ATO decided that in order to achieve adoption and decomission
legacy capabilities it must invest in a strategic platform that leverages international
data and messaging standards of an economy-wide scale.</p>
