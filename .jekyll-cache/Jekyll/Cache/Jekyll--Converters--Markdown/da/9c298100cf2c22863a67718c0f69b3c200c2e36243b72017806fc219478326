I"ž<p>As e-invoicing specialists, Capability Wise has been closely watching the progress of the joint Australian and New Zealand Governmentâ€™s Peppol e-invoicing initiative.  The initiative was <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/joint-statement-prime-ministers-rt-hon-jacinda-ardern-and-hon-scott-morrison-mp">originally announced</a> by the respective Prime Ministers back in February 2019, and is expected to save an estimated $30 billion in reduced transaction costs.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/digital-business-plan-drive-australias-economic-recovery">Budget 2021 early announcements</a>, the Australian government has declared that it is going all in on e-invoicing.  <strong>Today the Prime Minister and Treasurer jointly announced a mandate for all Commonwealth Government agencies to support e-invoicing by 1 July 2022.</strong></p>

<p>This is a significant move that is intended to bolster Australiaâ€™s post-COVID economic recovery.  In the announcement, <strong>the Prime Minister also flagged the intention to consult on mandatory adoption of e-invoicing by all Australian businesses</strong>.</p>

<p>So how exactly does e-invoicing assist economic recovery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppliers to Australian Government Agencies will be able to access favourable payment terms when they e-invoice a government customer.  Enabled Government agencies will pay supplier valid e-invoices on contracts under $1m within 5 business days.</li>
  <li>The Australian e-invoicing network will soon be able to support digital e-invoice response messages.  This will allow business to see the processing status of their e-invoices, saving time and more spent on follow up phone calls and emails.</li>
  <li>E-invoices cost less to process than their paper and PDF equivalents â€“ reducing government operating costs by between $8 and $20 per invoice.</li>
</ul>
