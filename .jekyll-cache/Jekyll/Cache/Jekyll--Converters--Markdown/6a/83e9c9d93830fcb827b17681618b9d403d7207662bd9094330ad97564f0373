<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) collects data from numerous sources to support its
compliance activities and to enable streamlined reporting of circumstances for Australian
Businesses and Citizens.</p>

<p>The timely collection and processing of data to produce a high quality, trusted information
asset is critical to ensuring participation in the taxation system and a level playing
field for Australians.</p>

<p>Over the past decade the number of data sources, the frequency of data collection and
variety of data formats has grown substantially. The ATO identified a need to enhance its
technology infrastructure to include a flexible, robust and performant data collection and
validation platform, known as the Bulk Data Exchange (BDE).</p>

<p>The team from Capability Wise and eBlueprint collectively led the $13 millon project to
implement an enterprise-class Bulk Data Exchange. This included all facets of the delivery
lifecycle including, but not limited to project management, scoping, technical design,
build, implementation and the hyper-support period.</p>

<p>The team liaised with agency staff and external stakeholders including multi-national
software vendors, banks, insurance companies and other government departments to
ensure a fit-for-purpose and reliable solution was implemented within the project
period.</p>

<p>The Bulk Data Exchange is now a cornerstone component of the ATO‚Äôs data ecosystem,
collecting the bulk of ATO‚Äôs inbound data (by volume) and enabling secure external data
sharing between all levels of Australian government and select international government
bodies.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenges">The Challenges</h3>

<p>The ATO has been progressively increasing the volume of data it collects over the past 30 years to improve its understanding of each Business‚Äô and Citizen‚Äôs taxation circumstances. This information is often collected from third-party organisations in whatever format it is available and using whatever data transfer protocol minimised the barriers to data collection. This approach whilst maximising the available data sources resulted in a disparate suite of connections, formats and platforms that were time consuming and difficult to effectively manage.</p>

<p>The ATO sought to improve this situation through the creation of a single bulk data exchange platform that was capable of collecting and validating third-party data in various formats, supporting common connection protocols and providing a single administrative and technology control tower to manage key data transfer activities.</p>

<h3 id="how-our-consultants-helped">How Our Consultants Helped</h3>
<p>To support the ATO to achieve their target outcome the teams from Capability Wise and eBlueprint jointly delivered the enterprise-class BDE Platform.</p>

<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>

<p>The Bulk Data Exchange Project has been a major success for the Australian Taxation Office. Within the first week of operation the ATO received several positive unsolicited feedback items from Australian Businesses, including a statement that the solution was ‚Äúthe best new IT System the Australian Taxation Office has introduced in years‚Äù.</p>

<p>The solution has been identified as one of two long-term strategic data collection channels that will support the ATO‚Äôs ongoing requirements between now and 2024. BDE continues to be extended by the business to enable more and more data interconnections across federal, state and territory agencies, local governments and international government partners.</p>

<p>BDE also supports the ATO to connect securely with major private sector organisations including banks, private health funds and share registries through direct machine-to-machine technologies. Additionally, it integrates directly behind the ATO‚Äôs Web Channels to provide Australian Businesses and Tax Agents with a low barrier entry point for digital data transfer.</p>
