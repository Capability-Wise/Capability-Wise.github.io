<p>The Australian education sector is one of the primary drivers of the countryâ€™s GDP and the Australian higher education market is valued at $32 Billion catering to 500,000+ international students. On the other hand, to enable Australians to continuously acquire latest skills, federal and state governments funded approximately $ 6.1 Billion for students undertaking continuing education and vocational training through TAFEs and Registered Training Organisations (RTOs).</p>

<p>The Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector is therefore one of the primary focus of the government in order to ensure that public funding is made available for the right programs of study, in the right location and in participation with relevant industry stakeholders.</p>

<p>Policy intervention is primarily driven by statistical data gathered by multiple agencies around student activity such as course enrolment, commencement, completion and field of study etc at a federal and state level. Over the years, the sector has faced numerous challenges in collecting this data effectively and utilising it or timely policy intervention due to the complexity of the operating environment.</p>

<h4 id="the-challenges">The Challenges</h4>
<p>In 2017 the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training identified the following requirements as key priorities for VET stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Timely and frequent data collection across states and territories</li>
  <li>Access to high quality and complete data for funding management;</li>
  <li>Shared management of data and processes;</li>
  <li>Linkage-ready data to enable more complex business processes and insights;</li>
  <li>More flexible and agile data standards;</li>
  <li>Self Service Reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>The main drivers of adopting the above thematic requirements was the incumbent processes and systems to collect data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quarterly collection of data form TAFEs and RTOs causing delayed payments, fraudulent activities, over-payment and resource intensive administrative work for stakeholders</li>
  <li>Batch based data acquisition approach prone to failures and errors</li>
  <li>18-month lead time to amend the data standard and processes</li>
  <li>Each state and territory having its own version of statistical data, data silos</li>
  <li>Various data governance issues such as
    <blockquote>
      <p>No established data governance framework 
No harmonisation or common data dictionary
Duplication of student records, multiple student identifiers, broken linkages across student journeys, ex post facto remediation of data by stakeholders etc</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>No consensus between federal and state government on a conceptual architecture to address the above issues</li>
</ul>
