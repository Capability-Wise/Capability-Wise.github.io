I"™<p>As e-invoicing specialists, Capability Wise has been closely watching the progress of the joint Australian and New Zealand Governmentâ€™s Peppol e-invoicing initiative.  Originally announced by the PMs back in February 2019, the initiative is expected to save an estimated $30 billion in reduced transaction costs.</p>

<p>As part of the Budget 2021 announcements, the Australian government has declared that it is going all in on e-invoicing.  Today the government announced a mandate for all Commonwealth, State, Territory and Local Governments to support e-invoicing by DATE X.</p>

<p>This is a significant move that is intended to bolster Australiaâ€™s post-COVID economic recovery.</p>

<p>So how exactly does e-invoicing assist economic recovery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppliers to Australian Government Agencies will be able to access favourable payment terms when they e-invoice a government customer.  Enabled Government agencies will pay supplier valid e-invoices within 5 business days.</li>
  <li>The Australian e-invoicing network will soon be able to support digital e-invoice response messages.  This will allow business to see the processing status of their e-invoices, saving time and more spent on follow up phone calls.</li>
  <li>E-invoices cost less to process than their paper and PDF equivalents â€“ reducing government operating costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a government agency interested in adopting e-invoicing or a supplier to government, Capability Wise can assist you to take the first steps on your e-invoicing journey.</p>
