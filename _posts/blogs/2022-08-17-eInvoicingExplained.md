#### Today's Invoicing Reality

Today’s invoicing processes largely involve technology as two digital bookends to a largely manual process of information exchange.  Despite many businesses having financial management software to create and store invoice data, in many cases the process of transmitting that invoice data from the buyer to the supplier generally involves either sending physical paper or a PDF attached to an email.

To a lesser extent some businesses use eInvoicing solutions for part of their supply chain, or manually transcribe data to/from their financial management software into one or more of their customers’ procurement web portals.  In many circumstances, SMBs will be required to manage multiple customer portals with varying practices and procedures.

On the other end of the transaction, for paper and PDF invoices an individual will either key the invoice data or use a scanning tools to identify critical data fields to be populated into their financial management system.  

Each step within these common business processes introduces the potential for delay, for example:
- An addressing error may result in the invoice being sent to the wrong person (impacts 1/5 of invoices)
- An invoice may contain incorrect data due to transcription errors or inconsistency with delivered goods and services (impacts 1/3 invoices)
- A paper invoice may sit in an inbox (physical or virtual) for a period before being actioned and may be overlooked or intentionally ignored.
- A PDF attached to an email may be incorrectly classified as spam by an email gateway, resulting in both trading partners being unaware of a failed delivery.

Furthermore, these common invoice practices involve a fire-and-forget approach where the system provides no natural feedback loop until the invoice is either paid or is overdue.  This results in effort for suppliers to chase bad debtors, who may have never received the invoice and weakens the trading partner relationship.

#### So what is eInvoicing?
**Electronic invoicing (or eInvoicing) is the automated digital exchange of invoice information directly between a buyer's and supplier's accounting systems, regardless of the software they use.**

**eInvoicing effectively eliminates the need for buyers and suppliers to manually handle invoices, providing a secure capability to exchange rich invoice data that can underpin intelligent automation and unlock cashflow.**

Although eInvoicing is not a new concept, a vibrant market for eInvoicing solutions for Small and Medium Businesses has been hindered by a fragmented technology approach, based around existing proprietary or closed standards.

Many large businesses have been eInvoicing for decades using 1st generation technologies like electronic data interchange (EDI). These communities operate in what is called a ‘hub and spoke’ model. The large organization can be thought of as the wheel hub and their trading partners connect like spokes on the wheel. 

The benefit of the ‘hub and spoke’ system is asymmetric and accrues mainly to the large company controlling the system and eInvoicing becomes a cost of doing business to their suppliers. This effect is even more notable when those trading partners, many of whom are small to medium businesses need to participate in multiple hubs, which often have different technology requirements.

As governments, commercial organizations and ERP providers have sought to optimize their benefits through invoice automation, market fragmentation has occurred.  Governments are now seeking to introduce new generation of eInvoicing frameworks and technologies to overcome these challenges.

Modern eInvoicing is considered superior to unstructured PDF and email-based invoicing solutions for the following reasons:
- Access to detailed line-item data in your accounting software, without manual inspection of the PDF or transcription.
- Emails containing PDFs can be caught in email spam filters or worse fraudulent.
- PDF solutions rely on a person configuring systems or manually forward PDFs to the correct email inbox, manually scanning with a smartphone or uploading to a portal.
- Scanning can be inaccurate and struggle to keep pace with changing invoice formatting.
- Email invoices have limited acknowledgement processes, beyond a possible read receipt.

eInvoicing enables the automated transmission of information throughout the supply chain with fewer mistakes, and this will speed up financial administration and notably reduce the amount of manual work.


#### What are the benefits of eInvoicing?

**Reduce work effort**

eInvoicing reduces or eliminates data recognition, transcription, and manual handling steps within the invoice processing lifecycle.  eIvoicing can reduce work effort, create opportunities for automation through access to rich invoice data, eliminate incorrect addressing problems and eliminate transcription errors.

Some eInvoicing providers also support the capability to “close the loop” through the provision of invoice response and status update messages.  This increased visibility minimizes the need to call customers to chase the processing status of an invoice or payment.

**Unlock faster payments / improve cashflow**

Cashflow is a critical issue for all SMBs and ineffective management of cashflow often results in business failure.  

eInvoicing eliminates many of the common delays in the invoice processing lifecycle making it easier for buyers to just accept and pay outstanding invoices.  Some organizations are implementing straight-through processing for low value invoices that meet automated matching criteria.  

A 2019 study undertaken by the European Commission found that eInvoicing has reduced payment times by 55% in France, and by an average of 10 days in Belgium.

A pilot undertaken by BOC Gas in Australia resulted in a material increase in on-time payments and an increase in early payments amongst the same customer cohort following the switch to eInvoicing.

**More secure**

Australian businesses continue to suffer from relentless fraud and cyber-security threats, including Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Payment Redirection Scams.

Invoice redirection fraud, a sub-set of BEC, is one of the most common strategies cybercriminals use to take advantage of businesses today. Impersonating a business or supplier, cybercriminals access emails, intercept invoices or change bank account details to redirect the payment, leaving the invoice outstanding and the real supplier unpaid.

Australian businesses lost over $227 million dollars to this type of fraud in 2021.

eInvoicing networks are actively seeking to reduce this risk through the application of Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for eInvoicing service providers.  Policies vary across eInvoicing networks and regions but generally upon signing up for, and annual renewal of eInvoicing services, the service provider is required to:
- Verify that a business is legitimately registered in its nominated country of registration.
- Verify that an individual has a relationship with that business or is authorised to act on its behalf.

Some regional eInvoicing authorities, Singapore for example, provide services to support these verification checks and may also require businesses to use a government-issued digital identity credentials as part of the registration process. 

In Australia, businesses should start using payment services like BPAY that support Payee verification and the new PayTo service which allows customers to PayTo your Australian Business Number, removing the ability redirect payments to illegitimate bank accounts.

**Positive climate impact**

Many governments and businesses are actively considering how they can minimize their impact on the environment, seeking to actively reduce or offset their emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Traditional paper-based invoicing processes involve several inputs and processing steps that generate emissions on a small scale that result in a significant cumulative impact.
The reduction in emissions can be attributed to the following:
1. Reduction in time spent by staff processing the invoice.
2. Elimination of paper and envelope production
3. Elimination of postal services (transportation)
4. Encouraging digital only archiving/records keeping practices.
