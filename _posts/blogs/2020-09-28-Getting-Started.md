As e-invoicing specialists, the first question we often get asked **“where do I start?”**  

With over 18 commercial e-invoicing Access Points accredited by the ATO in the last 12 months, **“shouldn’t we just pick one and let them sort it out?”**

**I think we all truly know the answer to that question is… NO.**
