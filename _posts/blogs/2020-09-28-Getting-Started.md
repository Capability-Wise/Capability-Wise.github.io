As eInvoicing specialists, the first question we often get asked **“where do I start?”**  

With over 30 commercial Peppol eInvoicing Access Points accredited by the ATO in the last two years, **“shouldn’t we just pick one and let them sort out this eInvoicing thing for us..?”**

**I think we all truly know the answer to that question is… NO.**
