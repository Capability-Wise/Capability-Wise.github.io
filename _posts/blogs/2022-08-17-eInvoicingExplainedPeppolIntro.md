#### The Peppol Origin Story

In 2008 the European Commission recognized the lack of consistent, royalty-free standards was creating a barrier to cross-border procurement for public-sector entities within its 28 Member States.  To reduce the market imbalance for SMBs, reduce market fragmentation and to overcome interoperability issues, the European Commission funded a large-scale pilot originally known as Peppol (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) to explore and test new approaches to digital trade. 
 
The Peppol pilot demonstrated that a Buyer’s and Supplier’s existing Financial Management Systems could securely exchange structured invoice data using a network of Access Point Providers, who could communicate using open, royalty-free technology standards.  

This model is known as the four-corner model and is similar to how cell-phone networks allow different brands of phone, connected to different cellular providers, to connect seamlessly to each other using just the destination phone number.

In the Peppol Network a buyer or supplier is identified using a Peppol Participant Identifier.  Generally, the Participant Identifier is a business’ unique legal identifier in its country of registration, for example a UEN (Singapore), ABN (Australian) or NZBN (New Zealand).  

This identifier is then used in real-time to determine which Access Point connects the business to the Peppol network and what digital business documents they are enabled to receive.  This process is known as dynamic discovery and leverages open standards to ensure that businesses can easily shift between Peppol service providers or advertise support for new Peppol business documents.

Following the success of the initial pilot the ability for all public entities to accept electronic invoices (B2G) was legislated as EU Directive 2014/55/EU, and subsequently enacted as law in most EU member countries and mandated for federal-level Public Administrations since April 2020. 

#### Peppol Goes Global

Peppol eInvoicing has subsequently been mandated for Business-to-Business (B2B) in a number of EU countries, and over the past 24 months has extended its reach to the Asia-Pacific regions with implementations in Singapore, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.  

As part of this process the Peppol became a brand in it's own right, and no longer an acronym for the original project.

Peppol is actively working with government stakeholders across the global to expand the network.

#### Peppol is more that just a community..

The Peppol framework consists of several polices, practices and technology standards to achieve interoperability at a global scale.  

The most popular business document exchanged on the Peppol network is the eInvoice, but the Peppol framework supports a much more extensive suite of business documents, including:

| Pre-Award Business Documents | Post-Award Business Documents |
| --- |  --- |
| Expression of Interest | Catalogue | 
| Call for Tender | Punch Out | 
| Tender Status Request	| Order  | 
| Tender (Response) | Order Agreement | 
| Tender Receipt	| Despatch Advice | 
| Tender Questions / Answers	| Invoice | 
| Tender Clarifications	| Invoice Response | 


The Peppol document suite is regularly enhanced through a semi-annual release cycle which implement minor business rule updates and support for new code lists.  Significant changes to the framework (policy, data and technical) are progressed through Peppol’s domain communities and working groups.

Peppol is currently focusing on the following projects:

| Project Name | Description | 
| --- |  --- |
| **Peppol International Invoice (PINT)** | The Peppol International Invoice project is seeking to evolve the Peppol eInvoice to provide true global applicability.  It seeks to achieve this through creating a layered approach to invoice content that support a shared set of international core data elements, that can be processes by any Peppol recipient regardless of country. Overlayed on top of this core model is any regional or domestic trading rules and regulations, or industry specific requirements. |
| **Peppol CTC** | The Peppol CTC project is focused on defining a repeatable approach to supporting Continuous Transaction Controls within a Five Corner Model, involving a domestic tax authority.  This project is intended to provide Tax Authorities seeking to implement CTC or clearance models with an Off-the-Shelf eInvoicing framework, built on top of proven policies, practices and standards, with a ready-made marketplace of accredited eInvoicing solution providers. |
| **Peppol Logistics** | The Peppol Logistics project is seeking to extend the Peppol business document suite to support complex logistics and fulfilment scenarios. |
| **Peppol Pre-Award** | Peppol is continuing its work on the Pre-Award document suite to support other procurement strategies and mechanisms beyond tenders. |


It is anticipated that the outputs of each of these projects will be progressively incorporated into the Peppol framework over the next twelve to eighteen months.
